# The data set
This data set illustrates the acute mortality of flour beetles (Tribolium confusum) following 5 hour exposure to carbon disulfide gas.

# Variables

We have chosen to use the following naming convention: lower case words seperated by dots in the case of variables, and first word lowercase and any additional words in upper case for functions. An example of a variable structured via this naming convention might be weight.kg, and an example of a properly named function would be computeAverage.

```{r}
beetle.data <- read.csv("Data/beetle.csv")
str(beetle.data)
```


```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
beetle.data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dose.mg, y = mortality.rate)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```
