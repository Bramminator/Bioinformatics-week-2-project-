# The data set
This data set the mortality of flour beetles (Tribolium confusum) after exposure to carbon disulfide gas for 5 hours.

# Variables

We have chosen to use the following naming convention: lower case words seperated by _ in the case of variables, and first word lowercase and any additional words in upper case for functions. An example of a variable structured via this naming convention might be weight_kg, and an example of a properly named function would be computeAverage.

```{r}
beetle_data <- read.csv("Data/beetle.csv")
str(beetle_data)
```

## Libraries
```{r echo=TRUE, results="hide", message=FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
library(tidyverse)
```

## Plots
```{r}
beetle_data %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = dose_mg, y = mortality_rate)) +
    geom_point() +
    geom_smooth(method = 'lm')

```

Now let's compute if statistics verify the positive correlation between the dose and the mortality rate. The method between two continuous variables can be computed using a pearson correlation.
```{r}
x = beetle_data$dose_mg
y = beetle_data$mortality_rate
cor(x,y, method = "pearson")
```

As might have been expected, the correlation between both variables is strong.
