R Notebook for beetle data
================

  - [The data set](#the-data-set)
      - [Flour beetle](#flour-beetle)

This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you
execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code.

``` r
library(AICcmodavg)
data(beetle)
```

# The data set

This data set illustrates the acute mortality of flour beetles
(Tribolium confusum) following 5 hour exposure to carbon disulfide gas.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output
will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press
*Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the
editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code
chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the
editor is displayed.
